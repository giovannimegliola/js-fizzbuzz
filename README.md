# FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 into the console,but that:

- for multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples of 5 print “Buzz”.
- For numbers that are both multiples of 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”.

It's possible to apply different styles to the elements added to the DOM depending on whether the entered value is a number, a fizz, a buzz or a fizzbuzz.
